Object vs Singleton in kotlin

The singleton pattern restricts the instantiation of a class to a single object. It is useful in cases wherein you only need a single object to contain a global state.
To create a singleton, one has to make sure that
Only one instance can exist
It has global access
This is generally achieved by
Declaring all constructors private
Access is through static methods that ensures a single instance
An object in Kotlin (among its many purposes) is both a class definition and an instantiation of single instance combined. It is a first class language support for singletons.
